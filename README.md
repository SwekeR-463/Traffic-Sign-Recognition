# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

## Overview
The YOLOv11 model is trained to detect and classify traffic signs from a custom dataset. The goal is to enable real-time detection and recognition of various traffic signs to assist in driving scenarios.

**Model**: YOLOv11 for object detection
**Task**: Traffic sign detection and classification

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/project-wyyo5/grad_project-sbq7e/dataset/3)

## Inference
Below are some sample results from the trained model:
